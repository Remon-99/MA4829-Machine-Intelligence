<h1>MA4829 Machine Intelligence: Data Analysis</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In our project for the MA4829 Machine Intelligence course, we embarked on a comprehensive analysis of product survey data, focusing on extracting valuable insights from a limited dataset. Leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) among other advanced data mining techniques, we aimed to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships that could inform product design and development strategies. Our approach was meticulous, utilizing classification, clustering, association rule mining, and other methods to analyze the data thoroughly. The project allowed us to apply theoretical concepts learned in the course, integrating knowledge from various fields to enrich our analysis. By employing specific software tools for data analysis, we ensured our methods were both rigorous and replicable. This holistic analysis not only revealed key insights into consumer preferences and behaviors but also showcased our ability to apply machine intelligence concepts practically, offering valuable recommendations for product innovation and improvement.
